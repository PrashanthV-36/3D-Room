# 3D-Room
The 3D Room project is a creative web-based visualization built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that simulates a realistic 3D room environment. The project demonstrates the use of 3D transformations, perspective, and lighting effects to give users the experience of being inside a virtual room.
